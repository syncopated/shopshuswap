Working together, we will get through this. That has been the message across the country as we all deal with the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Working together is also how the Shuswap region intends to move forward with its COVID-19 Emergency Economic Response Plan.

Shuswap Economic Development, Shuswap Tourism, Salmon Arm Economic Development Society, Community Futures Shuswap and the Tsuts'weye Womenâ€™s Entrepreneur and Innovation Network have come together to develop a response to the economic impacts currently facing Shuswap businesses and organizations. The plan is designed to respond directly to the needs expressed by the local business community and stakeholder organizations.

It will help mobilize resources and offer supports to assist businesses with their immediate needs as the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve. This builds upon existing collaborative efforts and will supplement and support the response work being done by economic development and community support organizations across the region.

An Emergency Support Hub has been set up as a one-stop place for businesses seeking support to make contact. From the Hub, businesses will be able to access services in six key areas: resource sharing & emergency support line, workforce support, community marketing, mentorship & training, digital transition and financing & emergency cash flow.
